            A blockchain is a distributed database or ledger that is shared
            among the nodes of a computer network. As a database, a blockchain
            stores information electronically in digital format.

          The goal of blockchain is to store information digitally. In this way,
          a blockchain is the foundation for immutable ledgers, or records of
          transactions that cannot be altered, deleted, or destroyed. It totally
          open and Transparent data storage technology without showing the real
          identy of the owner or creator. It cannot be altered, edited or cannot
          be change if it has published on Block-Chain, So it is Resistant
          against malicious activity.
          <br />
          <br />
          In the recent years, the use of blockchains has exploded via the
          creation of various cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance (DeFi)
          applications, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and smart contracts.

        <p class="p11">
          Public blockchains are permissionless in nature, allow anyone to join,
          and are completely decentralized. Public blockchains allow all nodes
          of the blockchain to have equal rights to access the blockchain,
          create new blocks of data, and validate blocks of data. To date,
          public blockchains are primarily used for exchanging and mining
          cryptocurrency. You may have heard of popular public blockchains such
          as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. On these public blockchains, the
          nodes “mine” for cryptocurrency by creating blocks for the
          transactions requested on the network by solving cryptographic
          equations. In return for this hard work, the miner nodes earn a small
          amount of cryptocurrency. The miners essentially act as new era bank
          tellers that formulate a transaction and receive (or “mine”) a fee for
          their efforts.

        <p class="p22">
          Hybrid Blockchains lie somewhere between private and public blockchains, 
          depending on their architecture. Therefore, to get a good understanding of hybrid blockchains,
           one must first understand the differences between private and public blockchains. 
           As the name suggests, public blockchains are accessible to and managed by the public.

          By comparison, a private blockchain allows limited access to entities outside a 
          trusted few who were involved in the creation of the private blockchain. Typically,
           private blockchains have administrators who can control permissions of adding or 
           modifying data on a private blockchain. The most popular private blockchains include 
           the hyperledger fabric which is being developed as a competitor to Ethereum by IBM and quorum.

        <p class="p1"><h1 class="p1">Private Block-Chain</h1></p>
        <p class="p11">
          Private blockchain platforms focus mainly on privacy instead of full disclosures.
           So, if you are interested in a technology where privacy is the greatest concern, then private blockchains are surely for you.

          On the other hand, an enterprise needs security and privacy because they always deal with cyber-attacks. Also, as they are dealing with sensitive information all the time, it makes it difficult to keep everything at bay.
          
          Thus, if a company can use a private blockchain to tighten up its security facilities, then it’ll be impossible for any hacker to hack into the system.
